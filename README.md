#OpenGL 3D Scene with GUI and Camera

Built using only OpenGL and the necessary libraries (GLFW, GLEW, GLM, and stb_image.h), this project is a C++ OpenGL application. 
It has the following features:
- An interactive 3D camera that uses arrow keys and WASD
A modular shader system for real-time rendering; basic GUI integration (e.g., FPS, debug info display)
Texture support (via stb_image)
The lighting system, which includes point, directional, and ambient lights
Rendering of custom objects (floor, cubes, etc.)
